This is the Solana Game Server Client SDK*

The Client SDK is available under Apache License 2.0 while most of the actual engine
is public but private - meaning it's public for developers to understand and use for
debugging, but private and restricted for use outside of the official APIs.

The solana smart contracts developed by Tardigrade Life Sciences, Inc tend towards
being fully trustless (run exclusively on trustless networks) with all smart contract
code being public-by-default.
